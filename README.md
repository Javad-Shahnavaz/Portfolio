# Portfolio
I designed this website simple but creative to show both design and web development as my portfolio.
In creating this website, I was inspired by some websites and the ideas are not necessarily from my own mind. in Header, I made an illustration of a sunset in Photoshop and then entered it in HTML. And the rest are designed with CSS. And for some actives like the parallax effect, Vanila JavaScript has been used.

no Bootstrap and no other frameworks
